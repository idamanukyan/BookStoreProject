# BookStoreProject
The project's main goal was to develop an application that would allow clients to sign in to personal accounts and to do basic CRUD operations. The database of the application contained thousands of data and my goal was to create responsible and optimal application. The data of the database was inserted from the CSV file. Also, the application was working with multiple threads.
